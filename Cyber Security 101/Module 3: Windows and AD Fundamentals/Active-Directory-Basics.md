# Active Directory Basics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose of Active Directory and Windows domains.
- Identify core Active Directory objects and structures.
- Learn how Group Policy and delegation are used.
- Understand basic domain authentication, trees, forests, and trusts.

## Notes
- **Active Directory (AD)** centralizes management of users, computers, policies, and resources.
- A **Domain Controller (DC)** runs Active Directory Domain Services and handles authentication.
- Common AD objects include:
  - Users
  - Computers
  - Groups
  - Printers
  - Shared resources
- **Organizational Units (OUs)** organize users and computers and allow policies to be applied.
- **Security Groups** grant permissions to resources; users can belong to multiple groups.
- **Delegation** gives specific users limited administrative control over an OU.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** apply security and configuration settings to users and computers.
- Use `gpupdate /force` to immediately refresh Group Policy.
- **Kerberos** is the default authentication protocol in modern Windows domains.
- **NetNTLM** is a legacy challenge-response authentication protocol.
- **Trees** contain related domains that share a namespace.
- **Forests** contain multiple domain trees.
- **Trust Relationships** allow users in one domain to access resources in another when authorized.

## Lab
- Managed users, computers, groups, and OUs in Active Directory.
- Delegated password reset permissions to a user.
- Created and linked GPOs to restrict Control Panel access and enforce automatic screen locking.
- Organized workstations and servers into separate OUs.
- Tested domain authentication and retrieved the room flag.

## Conclusion
Active Directory provides centralized identity, access, policy, and device management for Windows environments. Understanding OUs, groups, GPOs, authentication, and trust relationships is essential for administering and securing enterprise networks.
