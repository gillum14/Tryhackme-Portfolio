# SOC L1 Alert Triage

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how SOC alerts are generated and managed.
- Learn common alert fields, statuses, and verdicts.
- Practice prioritizing and triaging alerts as an L1 analyst.

## Notes
- Alerts are generated when SIEM, EDR, or other security tools detect suspicious events.
- SOC L1 analysts review alerts, determine whether they are legitimate threats, and escalate complex cases.
- Important alert fields include:
  - Alert time
  - Alert name
  - Severity
  - Status
  - Verdict
  - Assignee
  - Description
  - Affected user, host, or command
- Alerts should be prioritized by:
  - New and unassigned status
  - Highest severity
  - Oldest alert first
- Basic triage workflow:
  - Assign the alert to yourself.
  - Move it to **In Progress**.
  - Review the alert details and surrounding activity.
  - Determine whether it is a **True Positive** or **False Positive**.
  - Document findings and close or escalate the alert.
- Playbooks and threat intelligence can help guide investigations.

## Lab
- Reviewed alerts in a simulated SOC dashboard.
- Prioritized alerts by severity, time, and status.
- Investigated alert details and classified each alert.
- Documented findings and closed completed alerts.

## Conclusion
This room introduced the SOC alert lifecycle and the responsibilities of an L1 analyst. I learned how to prioritize, investigate, classify, and document alerts using a structured triage process.
