# How Websites Work

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand how websites function and the roles of the front end and back end.
- Learn the basics of HTML and JavaScript.
- Identify common web security risks such as Sensitive Data Exposure and HTML Injection.

## Notes:
- Websites consist of two main components:
  - **Front End (Client-Side):** What users see and interact with in their browser.
  - **Back End (Server-Side):** Processes requests and returns responses.
- Core web technologies:
  - **HTML:** Defines the structure and content of a webpage.
  - **CSS:** Styles the appearance of a webpage.
  - **JavaScript (JS):** Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **HTML** uses elements (tags) such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` to structure content.
- HTML elements can include **attributes**:
  - **class:** Groups elements for styling.
  - **id:** Uniquely identifies an element.
  - **src:** Specifies the location of resources such as images or scripts.
- **JavaScript** can:
  - Modify webpage content dynamically.
  - Respond to user actions through events (e.g., `onclick`).
  - Be embedded directly in HTML or loaded from external files.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** occurs when developers unintentionally leave sensitive information (credentials, hidden links, API keys, comments, etc.) in the page source or client-side code.
- **HTML Injection** occurs when user input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject HTML or JavaScript that changes page content or behavior.
- **Input sanitization** is essential to prevent injection attacks and protect web applications.

## Lab:
- Repaired broken HTML code in the interactive lab to correctly render a webpage containing images.
- Explored how HTML structure affects webpage rendering.

## Conclusion:
Understanding how websites are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides the foundation for web security. Reviewing page source for exposed information and recognizing vulnerabilities like Sensitive Data Exposure and HTML Injection are key skills when assessing web applications.
