# Data Encoding

## Learning Objectives

- Understand ASCII.
- Understand Unicode.
- Learn the difference between UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.
- Understand how emoji are encoded.
- Understand what causes gibberish or unreadable characters.

## Notes

## ASCII

**ASCII** is a 7-bit character encoding standard.

It defines 128 characters, including:

- English letters
- Digits
- Basic punctuation
- Control characters

ASCII is limited because it was mainly designed around English-language text.

## Unicode

**Unicode** is a universal character encoding standard.

It assigns unique code points to characters from modern and historical writing systems around the world. Unicode also supports symbols, emojis, and special characters.

## UTF Encoding Standards

Unicode code points can be stored using different encoding formats.

| Encoding | Description |
|---|---|
| UTF-8 | Uses 1 to 4 bytes and is common on the web |
| UTF-16 | Uses 2 or 4 bytes |
| UTF-32 | Uses 4 bytes for every character |

## Emoji Encoding

Emojis are represented by Unicode code points.

For example, an emoji may look like one symbol on screen, but the computer stores it as one or more Unicode values encoded into bytes.

## Gibberish Characters

Gibberish characters can appear when text is decoded using the wrong encoding.

For example, text saved in UTF-8 may not display correctly if a system tries to read it as ASCII or another incompatible encoding.

## Lab Completed

Completed a lab to learn about ASCII, its limitations, Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and how Unicode supports world languages, symbols, chess pieces, and emojis.

## Companion Script

This repo includes a Python script named `encoding_inspector.py`.

The script accepts text input and shows how each character is represented using:

- Unicode code points
- ASCII, when supported
- UTF-8
- UTF-16
- UTF-32

It also demonstrates why decoding text with the wrong encoding can cause errors or unreadable output.

## What This Demonstrates

This project shows a basic understanding of:

- Character encoding
- ASCII limitations
- Unicode code points
- UTF encoding formats
- How text becomes bytes
- Why encoding matters in computing and cybersecurity

## Conclusion

Characters are stored as numbers with agreed meanings. Encoding standards define how those numbers are represented so systems can correctly store, transmit, and display text.
