# Client-Server Basics

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the client-server model.
- Understand foundational networking concepts at a surface level:
  - DNS
  - Client
  - Server
  - Port
  - Protocol
  - Network

## Notes

## Client-Server Model

The client-server model describes how devices communicate over a network.

A **client** initiates communication by making a request. A **server** receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response.

A common example is a web browser requesting a webpage from a web server.

## Request and Response

When a browser visits a website, the browser acts as the client. It sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested webpage or resource.

## Protocol

A **protocol** defines how a client and server communicate.

Protocols create rules for formatting, sending, receiving, and interpreting data between systems.

## Port

A **port** identifies a specific service running on a system.

When a client wants to access a service on a server, it must connect using the correct port.

Examples:

| Port | Common Service |
|---|---|
| 80 | HTTP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 22 | SSH |
| 53 | DNS |

## DNS

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**.

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. This allows users to visit websites using names instead of memorizing numerical IP addresses.

## HTTP and HTTPS

**HTTP** and **HTTPS** are client-server protocols used for the World Wide Web.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is processed independently. The server does not automatically remember previous requests unless additional mechanisms, such as cookies or sessions, are used.

## Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| GET | Retrieve data |
| POST | Submit data |
| PUT | Replace existing data |
| DELETE | Remove data |
| PATCH | Partially update data |
| HEAD | Retrieve headers only |
| OPTIONS | Show supported communication options |
| CONNECT | Establish a tunnel to a server |
| TRACE | Echo the received request for diagnostic purposes |

## Lab Completed

Completed a lab for the `GET` method and examined the requests a browser sends when navigating to a website.

## Companion Script

This repo includes a Python script named `client_server_demo.py`.

The script creates a simple local server and client using Python sockets. The client sends a request, the server receives it, and the server sends a response back to the client.

## What This Demonstrates

This project shows a basic understanding of:

- Client-server communication
- Requests and responses
- Ports
- Protocol concepts
- Local network communication
- Basic Python socket usage

## Conclusion

This module explored how devices on the internet offer services to each other.

The client initiates communication, and the server replies. This model is the foundation for many network services, including websites, email, DNS, and remote access.

Conclusion - explored how devices on the internet can offer services to each other. We focused on the client-server model, which is similar to ordering a pizza. The client initiates the communication and the server replies.
