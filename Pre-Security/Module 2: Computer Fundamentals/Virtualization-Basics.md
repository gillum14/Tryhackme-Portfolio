Learning objective:
~ Understand why managing applications on individual physical servers is inefficient.
~ Learn how virtualization addresses hardware utilization and scalability challenges.
~ Understand the components of a lab machine.
~ Learn how containers have further optimized hardware utilization for applications.

Notes:
- In the early days, digital services were run on physical machines, and each machine typically had a single, clear purpose, such as hosting a website or storing data. This meant that if a company wanted to run a website, a database, an email service, and an internal app, they would need separate physical servers for each one.
- A virtualization layer, called a hypervisor, was introduced to act as a referee between lab machines and allow each virtual computer to behave independently, like a physical computer.
- Hypervisor: 
Divides a physical computer into multiple virtual ones.
Gives each lab machine its own share of CPU, memory, and storage.
Keeps everything isolated and safe.
Manages the lifecycle of lab machines (start, stop, pause, clone, delete).
- Hypervisors have two main types of implementation:
Type 1 hypervisors run directly on the physical hardware, making them fast, efficient, and ideal for servers and professional environments.
Type 2 hypervisors run within an existing operating system, making them easier to install and ideal for learning, testing, or small setups.
- A Lab Machine (VM) is a virtual computer created by the hypervisor.
- You can deploy VMs on your own computer using tools such as Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation. This type of software acts as a type 2 hypervisor and lets you run multiple operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- A container is a lightweight, isolated environment that runs a single application and all the necessary components to support it.
- Docker is an open-source software platform that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and running applications using containerization.
- Virtualization: Enables a single physical computer to act like multiple separate computers.
- Hypervisor: The “manager” software that makes and runs the virtual computers.
- Lab Machine (VM): A whole virtual computer inside the real one, with its own system.
- Container: A small, isolated box for one app that shares the same system as the host.
- Container Images: A pre-packed recipe/template used to create containers.
- Network Ports: Special numbered entry points that apps use to talk over the network.

** Completed a lab: Your manager has asked you to investigate an issue with the email service. Essentially, everyone in the company stopped receiving emails today, and no one knows what happened.

Conclusion - learned why virtualization is such a critical foundation in modern IT, both for maximizing hardware efficiency and for safely isolating environments.
